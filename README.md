# ProtonTherapy-TCP-Relapse-SecondCancer
We incorporated tumour relapse kinetics into the TCP framework and calculate the associated 
second cancer risks. To calculate proton therapy-induced secondary cancer induction, we used the 
initiation–inactivation–proliferation formalism, and in-vitro data to model the linear energy transfer (LET) 
dependence of cell killing and mutation induction parameters. As a clinical application, we employed the 
mathematical model to Hodgkin's Lymphoma patient data.
